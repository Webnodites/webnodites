	          <p>Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money, dress), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs originating in Ancient Rome.</p>

	          <p>Free Games websites are a fun way to play games online without any download. However, your experience can become a hassle if the website you visit is the opposite of fun.It has several categories of flash games including Puzzle, Action, Zombie, Funny etc. The games on this website require little to no downloading and start playing with just one click. However, the site is full of unskippable 15-second ads and some games have no clear instructions on how to play them.</p>

            <h2>MedTech</h2>
            <p> Many people came to treat the internet as a first, or at least a major, source of information and communication. Health advice is now the second-most popular topic, after pornography, that people search for on the internet.[2] With the advent of broadband and videoconferencing, many individuals have turned to online doctors to receive online consultations and purchase prescription drugs. Use of this technology has many advantages for both the doctor and the patient, including cost savings, convenience, accessibility, and improved privacy and communication.</p>
